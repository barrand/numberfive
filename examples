Celebrate spontaneity at the W New York - Union Square. Between the hotelâ€™s signature Whatever/Whenever service and its ideal location in Manhattan's Silicon Alley across from Union Square, the big city and indulgence are at your fingertips. One of New York's great public spaces, Union Square hosts a fabulous outdoor market 4 days a week. Pick up a loaf of artisan bread and a wedge of farmstead cheese for a picnic on the fly. Here, too, you'll find the Union Square subway station, a transportation hub that'll get you all around town. Venture south via a 5-minute ride to the Off-Broadway theaters and coffeehouses of Greenwich Village, or farther south to SoHo's galleries.
To tour New York in top style, look to the W for help. The complimentary Acura Experience spoils you with a personal driver and a luxury SUV stocked with W treats. If you're truly in the mood for spoiling, request anything (legal) you want with Whatever/Whenever (fees vary). Feel like a guitar serenade or a foot massage while en route to Chinatown? Just ask.

There's no need to leave the hotel for unforgettable nightlife. Sneak away with someone special to a private alcove in sexy, subterranean Lilium, whose seductive vibe represents the dark, mysterious feel of downtown New York. This newly redesigned bar offers a menu of traditional cocktails along with a full bar featuring boutique, small-batch spirits. Or engage in some couch-side banter in the cozy Living Room lounge before moving on to Olives restaurant, created by celebrated chef Todd English and serving rustic Mediterranean cuisine. Still feeling energetic? SWEAT, the hotel's fitness center, is open 24 hours.

Housed in a gorgeous 1911 Beaux Arts building, this Manhattan hotel is defined by elegance, and the guestrooms are no exception. A stylish sanctuary amid the city bustle, your room features the signature W bed: custom pillowtop mattress layered with plump, down bedding. Wrap yourself in a plush terry robe and settle in to watch a movie on the flat-panel TV. Refresh yourself with Bliss bathroom amenities and a nibble from 24-hour room service. Or fire up your laptop for wireless Internet access (surcharge).
